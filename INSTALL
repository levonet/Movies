System Requirements

  - root privilegies. Otherwise, you can still install using local::lib.
  - Perl 5.8.6 or higher.
  - Catalyst 5.8 or higher.
  - database: in theory, any database back-end supported by DBIx::Class.
    But Movies has been successfully tested with MySQL.
  - MTA: sendmail, postfix or another.
  - webserver: any supported with Catalyst.
  - mplayer for generating information about video files.

Install Catalyst

  This can be as easy as
    # cpan Catalyst::Runtime Catalyst::Devel
  and answer yes to all prompts (there will be a lot of them).
  To force an automatic "yes" to prompts, run
    # PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Catalyst::Runtime Catalyst::Devel

Install Movies

  Download and extract tarball to your httproot directory from
  http://ftp.yalta.net.ua/pub/Movies/

  To install all the required modules using CPAN, go to Movies root
  directory and run:
    # perl Makefile.PL
    # make installdeps

Configure and prepare Movies to run

  movies.conf is the main configuration file and is in Config::General format.

  First make sure your config file has a valid DSN for your database. The
  setting you change is in the connect_info hash in the Model::DB block.

  For instance, for MySQL:
      dsn       dbi:mysql:database=movies;host=localhost
      user      db_user
      password  db_password

  For MySQL you want to create the database first:
    > create database movies;

  Once the DSN is setup, we "deploy" the schema and some initial data to
  the Movies database my running the following script:
    # ./script/movies_spawn_db.pl

  This script has sane defaults for a test initial, but you can override
  this. Run it with --help to see usage information.

Launch test

  Movies is a Catalyst application and works with Catalyst's built-in web
  server, or with an external one.

  Catalyst includes a test server with can be started using:
    # ./script/movies_server.pl

  And you can connent to your server at
    http://localhost:3000

Deployment with other external servers

  Please see the Catalyst deployment page on the Catalyst wiki
    http://wiki.catalystframework.org/wiki/deployment/

Login

  Login to your Movies and change the admin password. The default
  login/pass is admin/admin
